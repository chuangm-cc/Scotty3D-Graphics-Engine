## Feedback

Use this section to provide feedback about the assignment.
Task1:
encountered problems: Setting up env in VS is easier than VS Code in Windos.
To get the debug env set up in VS code took me a lot of time.
time spent: 3 hours

Task2:
This is much easier than task3.
time spent: 2 hours

Task3:
This is kind of difficult. It took me a lot of time to locate the error in Data pentagon(float r) in 'util.cpp'
I used to thought the problems are in somewhere else and done many other changes and still get wrong.
Then I spent time learning about halfedge meshes, then solved the problem.
time spent: 6 hours
