This is an animation that the cow move and jump on the ball, then they will move for a while until

(##) EXTRA CREDIT FINAL

(##) Feedback

Use this section to provide feedback about the assignment.

T1:

8 hours. Just implemnet the task isn't very difficult. However, need to check about a lot of 
corner cases and some special cases, especailly how normalization affects the value computed by the subroutine.

T2:

10 hours: The most difficult part is to get the gradient. By visiting OH, I can successfully figure out the logic and 
the right formula to use for that part.

T3:

12 hours: this task is not difficult to understand. But there are many things to notice. I don't do the 
check of size of weights until I visited OH. Besides, bind-to-current transformation matrices is easy to make 
mistakes.

T4:

18 hours: this task is kind of difficult to me for there are lots of corner cases to notice. For example, need to make sure to Use
unit(), the situation that v is 0 or t is less than 0. I have visited 3 OH to finish 
this part.
