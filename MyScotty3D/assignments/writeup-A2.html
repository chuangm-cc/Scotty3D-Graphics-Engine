(##) CREATED MODEL FINAL

Image of model in the GUI:

</div>
Explanation of what it is and how you made it:

This is based on last HW, I applied methods like loop to make it more smooth and more
like a space ship. At begining, they are not smooth enough, but after applying these methods,
the object becomes more smooth and more like space ship.

Any free model sources you need to credit?

No

(##) Feedback

Use this section to provide feedback about the assignment.

I have writen many extra test cases especially for split and flip.

A2L1:

3 hours.

For this is the first task. I have to spend a lot of time to review the course and 
learn what steps I need to do for this part. Besides, some operation like
connection may be forgotten, and the order of each operation matters.

I found that using ->id to debug is useful.

A2L2:

5 hours.

For this task, I need to read the halfedge.h and halfedge-utility for there are 
lots of useful functions inside. Also, there are more edge cases to considered compared 
with the last task.

A2L3:

4 hours

For this task, I think finding if there are extra dege to delete can be difficult. To handle
edge cases, it takes much time.

A2L4:

6 hours.

For this task, I start to use vectors and for loop to store the objects I may use later. By using
vectors and loop, it really helps.


A2Lx1:

4 hours.

This task also requires using of loop and store objects in vectors.

A2Lx2:

3 hours.

For I have the expriences by doing the above tasks, this is not that hard.

A2Lx3:

4 hours.

This is kind of simialr like previous tasks, but need to consider more cases.

A2Lx4:

3 hours

This is not so hard for using loop can make it easier.

A2Lx7:

4 hours

Corner case not easy to solve.

A2Lx8:

4 hours

Kind of same like lx7.

A2G1

2 hours

Not difficult.

A2G2

1 hours

Not difficult.

A2G3

3 hours

Not very difficult.

A2Go1

10 hours.

Very difficult, also need to write extra test cases for splite and other functions.

Need to consider so many corner cases.

A2GO2

5 hours.

Also kind of difficult, I have implemented it according to guidence, but still some problems.
